# Japanese Head Spa Prague

A responsive website for a fictional Japanese-style head spa, created as a portfolio project to showcase frontend development skills.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on responsive design, SCSS preprocessor usage, and thoughtful UI/UX decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **SCSS/Sass** - Variables, mixins, and nested styles for efficient CSS management
- **JavaScript** - Interactive elements including mobile menu toggle and booking calendar
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** - Modern layout techniques for responsive design
- **Mobile-first approach** - Ensuring optimal display across all device sizes

## Design Decisions ðŸŒ¸

- **Color Palette** - Soft blue-grays with sakura pink accents create a tranquil, Japanese-inspired aesthetic

- **Two-Step Booking** - Simplified user flow reducing cognitive load during the booking process
- **Responsive Components** - Elements like the treatment cards and booking form adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes
- **Visual Hierarchy** - Strategic use of whitespace, typography, and color to guide user attention
